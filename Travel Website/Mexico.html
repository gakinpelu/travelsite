    <h1> Say Hola to Mexico City </h1>
    <h2> The largest metropolis in the Western Hemisphere has so much to offer! </h2>
    
    <p class="paragraph"> A lot of friends think that I am crazy for going to Mexico City alone; stating that it's dangerous and that I should be scared. I say the only thing to be scared of is how much you will fall in love with the city and not be able to stop going yearly because there's so much goodness for so little money. Founded in the mid-1500's by the Spanish and built over the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, Mexico City has layers and layers of history and meso-American culture to explore.

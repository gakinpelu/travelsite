    <h1> Welcome to Prague!</h1>
    <h2> It's like stepping back in time...</h2>
    
    <p class="paragraph"> Prague was one of the few large cities spared by WWII bombers, so much of it's awesome medievaness is stil intact. You will even find the world's oldest in-tact synagogue here as well. I found Prague to be an understated destination-it's not quite as popular or well known as it's other larger, "flashier" European counterparts, but it's no less an amazing city to visit. It's cheap and if your diet consists of meat and potatoes, you will find yourself in heaven here.
